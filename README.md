## Hi, I'm Byron 👋

Aspiring Data Analyst & Data Scientist  
Python • SQL • Machine Learning • EDA • Time Series 

I work on applied data projects that focus on transforming raw data into actionable insights
and building predictive models to support data-driven decision-making.

### Core Focus Areas
- Data analysis and querying using Python and SQL
- Exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and visualization
- Classification and regression modeling with scikit-learn
- Time-series forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMAX
- Computer vision projects using deep learning techniques

### Selected Projects
- **Customer Churn Prediction** – Built and evaluated classification models using Python and SQL, focusing on F1 score and model interpretability.
