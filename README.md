## Hi, I'm Byron 👋

Aspiring Data Analyst & Data Scientist  
Python • SQL • Machine Learning • EDA • Time Series • Computer Vision • Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) • Data Visualization • Data Cleaning/ Preprocessing • Data/ Trend Analysis

I work on applied data projects that focus on transforming raw data into actionable insights
and building predictive models to support data-driven decision-making.

### Core Focus Areas
- Data analysis and querying using Python and SQL
- Exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and visualization
- Classification and regression modeling with scikit-learn
- Time-series forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMAX
- Computer vision projects using deep learning techniques

### Selected Projects
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project** – Performed exploratory and statistical analysis on multi-year video game sales data, including data cleaning and preprocessing, to evaluate   platform lifecycles, genre performance, and regional market trends (NA, EU, JP). Created analytical visualizations (histograms, bar charts, line plots, box plots, scatter plots) and      correlation analysis to assess the relationship between reviews and global sales for major platforms. Applied two-sample t-tests to compare user ratings across platforms and genres,      defining hypotheses and significance thresholds.

- **Customer Churn Prediction** – Built and compared multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost, Light GBM, and Cat Boost) to predict
  customer churn.  Performed data cleaning, preprocessing (scaling and encoding), EDA, and clustering for customer segmentation

- **Time-Series Forecasting** – Developed time-series forecasting models (AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMAX, Linear Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM) to predict future order volumes.
  Applied resampling, lag and rolling features, and ACF/PACF diagnostics for trend and seasonality detection.

- **Computer Vision** – Developed a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network using TensorFlow/Keras and ImageDataGenerator to predict customer ages from facial images.
  Performed EDA to visualize age distribution and verify dataset label accuracy.

### Experience
- **Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Data Science Externship** –
  -	Completed a real estate forecasting externship for Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, modeling average sold home prices using time-series techniques.
  -	Built, tuned, and compared AR, MA, ARMA, and SARIMAX models for multi-period forecasting.
  -	Performed extensive EDA, created trend/seasonality decomposition charts, correlation analysis, and feature-driven insights.
  -	Provided actionable recommendations to the company stakeholder based on model outputs and EDA-driven interpretations.
  -	Collaborated with a team to prepare and deliver a professional presentation of methodologies, results, and business implications.
